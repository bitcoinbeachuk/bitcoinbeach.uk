These companies were necessary to do something only they could do: verify that the person spending money actually has money to spend. Banks can do this because they hold everyone\u2019s money, so they know all account balances.</p> <p>But what's so great about not using banks and credit card companies? For starters, they are slow, expensive, and part of a broken financial system.</p> <p>Banks have huge costs for buildings, lawyers, and highly paid executives - all funded by the fees you pay (and massive taxpayer bailouts, like in 2008). Banks also limit how you can access and send your money.</p> <p>In 2008, a mysterious person calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin. To this day, Satoshi remains anonymous and nobody knows who he or she is.</p> <p>Satoshi could be a woman, a man, or a group of people. Nobody knows! What we do know is that the Bitcoin.org domain was registered in August 2008. Then, in November, Satoshi posted the famous Bitcoin whitepaper. </p> <p>The first Bitcoins were issued in January 2009. Embedded in the first Bitcoin code was the message \u201cChancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\u201d - hinting at Bitcoin\u2019s creation because of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>Bitcoin\u2019s breakthrough is that it\u2019s the first to solve a problem so tough, it has its own name: The Double Spend Problem.</p> <p>Here is how the Double Spend Problem works: Digital money is just like a computer file, so it would be easy for somebody to just \u201ccounterfeit\u201d it by copy and pasting. Before Bitcoin, the solution was for banks to keep track of the money in everybody's accounts, so that nobody could spend money twice.</p> <p>Bitcoin solves the Double Spend Problem differently. It makes all accounts and transactions public - but without revealing private details like your name. Since account balances are public, it would be obvious if someone used the same money twice. </p> <p>Once Bitcoin is sent, it\u2019s publicly added to the receiver\u2019s account. So if a scammer tries to spend their Bitcoin twice, it\u2019s easily discovered and prevented.</p> <p>Solving the Double Spend Problem is a big deal. It allows Bitcoin to be sent directly from one person to another, without using ANY third party like a bank.</p> <p>Not needing a third party (like a bank) to handle accounts and transactions has a lot of benefits. Transactions can be faster and cheaper since there is no middleman. </p> <p>Plus, your personal information becomes more private since no bank has to store it. You\u2019re probably beginning to see why Bitcoin is such a game changer.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#what-is-bitcoin","title":"What is Bitcoin?","text":"<p>Let's talk about why Bitcoin is so unique and revolutionary.</p> <p>Bitcoin is a new form of money that's completely digital. It can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world. There are no pounds, euros, dollars, or yen - it's a universal currency.</p> <p>Unlike traditional forms of money, there are no physical Bitcoins. No pound notes, no metal coins, no plastic cards \u2013 it's 100% digital! Everything is done from phones and computers. This allows for fast and cheap transactions around the world and around the clock.</p> <p>Incredibly, Bitcoin is not controlled by any person, company, or government. It's run by the community of its users. Read that twice, because it's important!</p> <p>Bitcoin users are located all around the world and use the internet to help send and receive payments. But unlike traditional payments that pass through banks, Bitcoin is sent directly from person to person, instead of from person to company to person. This is known as a peer-to-peer system (P2P). It means there is no central control.</p> <p>What's amazing is that none of the users in the Bitcoin community need to know each other for this system to work. You can send and receive Bitcoin online without needing to meet or even trust the other person. We'll explain how that's possible in a bit.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#bitcoin-benefits","title":"Bitcoin benefits","text":""},{"location":"bitcoin/#benefit-1-decentralised","title":"Benefit 1 - Decentralised","text":"<p>Traditional money is controlled by banks and governments \u2013 which makes it a \"centralised\" currency.</p> <p>Bitcoin is not controlled or regulated by any single entity like a bank \u2013 which makes it a \"decentralized\" currency.</p> <p>Having no banks in control makes sending and receiving money cheaper, faster, and easier.</p> <p>Not having banks involved means nobody can deny your application, nobody can close your account, and nobody can charge you outrageous fees. In short, banks are no longer in charge. This is what makes decentralised money so powerful.</p> <p>Over 2 billion people worldwide can't even get access to bank accounts! This prevents them from connecting with the rest of the world \u2013 they're excluded. To them, a bank is like a fancy club they can't get into. </p> <p>Bitcoin will give them the benefits of a bank, without needing a bank. Anyone with a smartphone and internet connection is welcome!</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#benefit-2-no-counterfeit-money","title":"Benefit 2 - No Counterfeit Money","text":"<p>Paper currencies, credit cards, and cheques can be counterfeit. If you've ever been a victim of fraud, you know how much this sucks.</p> <p>Bitcoin solves the Double Spend Problem which means criminals cannot create fake Bitcoins. Counterfeiting is impossible.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#benefit-3-limited-supply","title":"Benefit 3 - Limited Supply","text":"<p>Traditional money is created by governments in unlimited quantities. They print more constantly, which decreases the value over time.</p> <p>Bitcoin's supply is limited to 21 million coins. There can never be more! Why? It's designed to be scarce so that it increases in value over time.</p> <p>A constantly increasing supply of money creates something called inflation. This means that the money you are holding is worth a little less every day. If you're working hard and trying to save up, that's bad.</p> <p>Bitcoin's limited supply creates the opposite effect, called deflation. This means the value of each Bitcoin is designed to increase over time. It's part of the reason why so many people are excited about investing in Bitcoin.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#benefit-4-divisible","title":"Benefit 4 - Divisible","text":"<p>Old fashioned money can be spent only in amounts as small as a single pence (so up to 2 decimal places).</p> <p>Bitcoin can be spent in much smaller amounts, called satoshis (all the way up to 8 decimal places). This means that it can be used even for tiny purchases.</p> <p>Bitcoin is highly divisible because its value is designed to increase over time (through deflation). This divisibility means you can spend very small amounts of a Bitcoin. So basically, an ice cream cone may cost 0.0001 Bitcoin today, but in the future it may cost 0.00000010 Bitcoin, if Bitcoin's value rises even more.</p> <p>A practical example where Bitcoin's high divisibility is useful today is for microtransactions. These are very small payments used for digital goods and services. For example, imagine paying only a tiny amount of Bitcoin for every page of an ebook you read, instead of paying for the whole book. </p> <p>Microtransactions are something traditional money can't do, because pence are not divisible enough and therefore too big for very small purchases.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#benefit-5-security","title":"Benefit 5 - Security","text":"<p>There is a lot of money stored in Bitcoin, so it needs to be very secure. Bitcoin uses cryptography to securely send payments.</p> <p>That's why Bitcoin is called a cryptocurrency. The code is so strong that tampering is virtually impossible. There is A LOT of money held in Bitcoin, but it has never been hacked!</p> <p>In simple terms, cryptography is a technology that protects information through complex mathematical functions. Bitcoin uses strong cryptography to protect your account and let you securely send money. It's designed so that nobody can hack your account, and it prevents the wrong person from receiving your money.</p>"},{"location":"bitcoin/#how-does-bitcoin-work","title":"How does Bitcoin work?","text":"<p>Now that you know what Bitcoin is and why it exists, let's see how it actually works.</p> <p>Imagine four strangers sitting in a room, each with their own notebook. Because they are strangers, they don't know or trust each other.</p> <p>The four strangers in this example represent Bitcoin's community of users. We are using strangers to explain this, because in the real world, most Bitcoin users do not know each other. The notebooks in this example represent what's called the Bitcoin blockchain. The blockchain stores a public record of every single Bitcoin transaction ever made. The blockchain is not on paper but 100% digital and public. </p> <p>Most importantly, there are thousands and thousands of identical copies of the blockchain held by users around the world. All these copies are kept in sync by the system that runs the blockchain.</p> <p>One stranger gives one Bitcoin to another stranger. Now, EACH of the four strangers records this transaction. </p> <p>They then compare all their notebooks to make sure they match.</p> <p>Just like in the example, when Bitcoin is sent, the transaction is recorded on EVERY one of the thousands of copies of the Bitcoin blockchain around the world. Each copy is an identical record of all transactions.</p> <p>Just like notebooks were compared in the example, the Bitcoin system is constantly comparing all copies of the blockchain to make sure they all have matching transactions.</p> <p>If all four notebooks match up, everything is fine. The transaction is approved by everybody.</p> <p>If one notebook is different from the other three, we have a problem. It means one stranger is lying about the transaction. We also know which stranger is lying (hint: it's the one with the notebook that doesn't match the others). As a result, the three others ignore the notebook that doesn't match and move on. The transaction is not approved.</p> <p>The same two outcomes can happen with Bitcoin: If all blockchain copies match, everything is fine and the transaction will proceed.</p> <p>If one blockchain copy is different from all others in the Bitcoin network, the network automatically rejects the transaction that doesn't match the rest. This is what prevents fraud. It's impossible for scammers to manipulate the system, since their blockchain copy wouldn't match what everyone else agrees on.</p> <p>Bitcoin works exactly like the notebook example. Each Bitcoin user has an identical copy of the Bitcoin \"notebook\" which publicly records all transactions. All notebooks get constantly compared to make sure they match.</p> <p>Additionally, Bitcoin stores all past transactions permanently so that there is a record of where all Bitcoin currently are. This proves who owns which Bitcoin.</p> <p>In short, the Bitcoin blockchain knows where every single Bitcoin is at all times. This is very powerful since it proves ownership without needing a third party like a bank.</p> <p>Traditional currencies don't have a blockchain, so in some cases you can't prove who owns what. This makes fraud and theft easier. For example, imagine somebody steals \u00a320 in cash from you. You can't easily prove who owns it.</p> <p>The technology that stores and constantly compares Bitcoin's \"notebooks\" to make sure they are all identical is called the blockchain.</p> <p>Bitcoin's blockchain is the technology that allows strangers to work together to exchange money without trust. This means no middlemen like banks are needed.</p> <p>Instead of recording transactions in private record systems like a bank or credit card company does, Bitcoin users record ALL transactions at the SAME TIME in IDENTICAL copies of the blockchain. As a result, any attempt to fool the system would be noticed as obviously different and rejected by the system.</p> <p>This method of comparing all the identical \"notebooks\" is called finding a \"consensus\" - in other words a mutual agreement that the transaction isn't fraud. </p> <p>Bitcoin uses the same strategy to compare all transactions on the blockchain. It can do this very quickly by using powerful computer code. The process of comparing transactions using this computer code is known as Bitcoin's Consensus Algorithm.</p> <p>Blockchain is the technology that makes Bitcoin so valuable, because it removes the need for a costly third party (like banks and credit card companies) to check transactions.</p> <p>With blockchain, total strangers can now exchange money without any trust and without any third parties being required. That's revolutionary!</p> <p>Remember the tricky Double Spend Problem from before? The blockchain is what Bitcoin uses to prevent this problem from ever happening. </p> <p>Once a Bitcoin changes hands the transaction becomes an official blockchain entry that's automatically and permanently recorded, so the money can't be spent twice.
